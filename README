PHP Weathermap for Observium / LibreNMS
==============================================

This is a fork of https://github.com/casdr/weathermap - I'm not sure or the
providence before that. PHP Weathermap is licensed under the GNU Public
License and the Observium / Weathermap additions are the same.

This fork exists to support our own installations and support or help is
not offered. It is mainly to support PHP 7.0 and we have created a pull
request back to the fork origin for that:
